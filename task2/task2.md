# Task 2: Guessing the Key

- Timestamp of the encrypted file: `2018-04-17 23:08:49`
- The key may be generated within a two-hour window before the file was created.
- Need to be aware of timezone (EDT, Eastern Daylight Time, UTC-4), which is not explicit in the lab assignment. We are in BRT (Bras√≠lia Time, UTC-3).
